Basement Robotics: A 3d printed, arduino controlled robot arm
=================

![My image](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/6682410/IMG_20130328_210021.jpg)

So I built a little robot arm in my basement. All the parts that aren't motors are 3d printed. This repo collects both the Arduino code that controls the little guy and the STL files that make up all his bits and pieces. Additionally, there will be a shopping list of parts, circuit diagrams for the breadboard, assembly instructions and more. It is, obviously, a work in progress.

Shopping list
---------
* 1 Arduino, obviously.
* A good-sized breadboard.
* 4 hobbyist small-servos. [I bought from Sparkfun](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/9065), and these fit snugly the arms.
* 1 small stepper motor. [Again, Sparkfun](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/10551), and the base is sized to precisely fit this motor.
* 1 stepper motor controller. The code in this sketch is for controlling the [EasyDriver Stepper Motor](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/10267).
* 4 potentiometers. I am using three knobs for wrist, elbow, and shoulder control, and then one slide pot for the claw. You could also use a joystick, or all sliders, or whatever you want. 
* Jumper cable extensions. You're going to be creating a ratsnest of cables and, if you want the arm to have full movement, you're going to need to extend the servo connections and the stepper motor wire at a bare minimum.


TODO LIST
--------

* ~~upload all stl files~~ and images of each piece
* create shopping list
* create circuit diagram
* assembly instructions
* notes privisos, etc.
