So I built a little robot arm in my basement. All the parts that aren't motors are 3d printed. This repo collects both the Arduino code that controls the little guy and the STL files that make up all his bits and pieces. Additionlly, there will be a shopping list of parts, circuit diagrams for the breadboard, assembly instructions and more. It is, obviously, a work in progress.

TODO LIST:

* upload all stl files and images of each piece
* create shopping list
* create circuit diagram
* assembly instructions
* notes privisos, etc.
